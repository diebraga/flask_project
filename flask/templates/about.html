      <p>
        Thorin Oakenshield (TA 2746-November 23, TA 2941) was the heir of the royal Line of Durin, and the Dwarf king of Erebor from the time of the Battle of Moria to the Battle of the Five Armies. He was son of Thráin, son of Thror, brother of Frerin and Dis, uncle of the latter's sons, Fili and Kili, which - after the death of their father - Thorin saw as his own children.

        Thorin was a member of the Line of Durin and Thorin and Company as its leader.

        <p class="lead">Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were most often
            named only in "group" references to the entire company.</p>
