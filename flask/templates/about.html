      <h3>Glóin</h3>
      <p>
        Gloin was born sometime after Smaug took over the Lonely Mountain. He was well loved by his elder brother, Oin and was close with Thorin and Dwalin.

        Glóin is a banker and is responsible for putting up the financing for the Quest of Erebor, which reportedly led to him being "bled dry."
        Glóin falls with the others when they go to Bilbo's house. Glóin also is rude by ruining Bilbo's other possessions. He sits by his brother, and it is implied that he watched all the signs for Erebor, seeing he knows what to say at dinner. He seems to have to watch over his older brother because he is half-deaf.

He was the second to last characters to arrive at Bilbo's house toppling on the floor with the rest of the guests (except Balin, Dwalin, Fili and Kili and Thorin) falling on the ground. He offered Gandalf first a camomile tea and then red wine. Dori was also an attendance to the meeting there. Dori later rescued Bilbo Baggins, who foolishly followed with Fili and Kili's plan to rescue the ponies himself. 
        
        He also crossed through Rivendell and survived through the struggle in the Misty Mountains. Dori was also one of the dwarves to go with Thorin to the Lonely Mountain. He also fought and surived the Battle of the Five Armies.
